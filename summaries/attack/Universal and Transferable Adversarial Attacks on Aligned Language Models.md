Zou et al. (2023) propose a universal automated approach for adversarial attacks on LLMs. It involves generating a suffix to be added to various queries, prompting the LLM to produce inappropriate content. This method merges greedy and gradient-based search techniques to automatically create these adversarial suffixes. The adversarial prompts produced by this method are highly transferable, even to black-box, publicly available, production LLMs.
