AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023a), an automated, interpretable, gradient-based adversarial attack method for LLMs, combines the strengths of manual jailbreak attacks and automatic adversarial at

tacks. It generates readable prompts that bypass perplexity filters while maintaining high attack success rates. It formulates the attack as an optimization problem and employs a hierarchical genetic algorithm to search for effective prompts in the space initialized by handcrafted prompts. Their method operates at multiple levels - sentence and word - to ensure both diversity and finegrained optimization.
